On Kaggle, there is a dataset called Titanic, which includes features such as gender, age, embarkation location, ticket number, name, etc. The last column indicates whether the person survived or not. Our task is to design a model for prediction. Since our final outcome is a binary classification target (either survived or not), we should use classification algorithms.

I have chosen the following four algorithms for designing this model:

1. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): KNN is a nearest neighbor algorithm. It predicts the class of a sample based on the classes of similar samples (nearest neighbors) using Euclidean distances or other similarities.
2. Support Vector Machine (SVM): SVM is a classification algorithm that separates data into different classes using an optimal hyperplane (or hyperplane with a kernel) that maximizes the margin between two classes.
3. Logistic Regression: This regression model is used for binary classification tasks (e.g., predicting survival or not). It utilizes the logistic function to estimate class probabilities.
4. Random Forest: Random Forest is an ensemble model that combines multiple random decision trees. It is suitable for complex predictions.
