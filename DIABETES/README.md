# Diabetes Detection Using SVM

In this project, I designed a machine learning model to classify individuals based on whether they have diabetes or not. The model utilizes the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. SVM is a powerful machine learning technique for binary classification tasks. It works by finding the optimal hyperplane that best separates the data points into two classes (diabetic and non-diabetic) based on relevant features.

## Data
For training the model, I used a large dataset containing information about both diabetic and non-diabetic individuals. The dataset includes various features such as age, gender, BMI, and more.
